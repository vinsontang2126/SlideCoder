**SlideCoder: Layout-aware RAG-enhanced Hierarchical Slide Generation from Design**

We propose a benchmark named **Slide2Code** in our paper. The dataset is divided into three complexity levels:

* Slides numbered \[1, 100] are **Simple**
* Slides numbered \[101, 200] are **Medium**
* Slides numbered \[201, 300] are **Complex**

The folder structure is as follows:

* `Slide2Code/background`: contains the **backgrounds** of the slides
* `Slide2Code/foreground`: contains the **foregrounds** (with the background changed to gray to match white text)
* `Slide2Code/forewopic`: contains the **Design** images
* `Slide2Code`: contains the full **Slide Pictures**
* `origin`: contains the **original slide images
