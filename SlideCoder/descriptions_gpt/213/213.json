Below is a detailed description of the slide's layout and content:\n\n---\n\n### **Overall Layout**\nThe slide is divided into three main vertical sections, each addressing a specific category: **Data**, **Software**, and **Publications**. These sections are separated by thin vertical lines, creating a clean and organized appearance. The background is light gray, providing a neutral tone that enhances readability. The text is primarily black, with key phrases highlighted in blue to draw attention to important points.\n\n---\n\n### **Header**\n- **Text:** \"What are the **new** proposed changes?\"\n- **Font Style:** Bold, with the word \"new\" highlighted in blue for emphasis.\n- **Placement:** Centered at the top of the slide, serving as the title and framing the content below.\n\n---\n\n### **Main Content**\nThe slide is divided into three vertical sections, each with a bold heading and detailed text underneath:\n\n#### **1. Data (Left Section)**\n- **Heading:** \"Data\" (bold and black).\n- **Content:** \n  - **Scientific data:** Should adhere to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) and be made publicly available with an open, accessible data license. This should occur no later than the publication of the research, and the data should be citable.\n  - **Mission data:** Must be openly available with no period of exclusive access.\n- **Key Highlights:** Phrases like \"FAIR,\" \"publicly available,\" and \"be citable\" are in blue to emphasize their importance.\n\n#### **2. Software (Middle Section)**\n- **Heading:** \"Software\" (bold and black).\n- **Content:** \n  - **Research software:** Should be publicly available no later than the publication of the research, assigned a permissive software license, and be citable.\n  - **Mission software:** Should be developed openly on a publicly accessible, version-controlled platform that allows for community contributions and engagement.\n- **Key Highlights:** Phrases like \"publicly available,\" \"permissive software license,\" and \"community\" are in blue to emphasize collaboration and accessibility.\n\n#### **3. Publications (Right Section)**\n- **Heading:** \"Publications\" (bold and black).\n- **Content:** \n  - **Manuscripts:** As-accepted versions should be deposited in a NASA repository and made publicly available within 12 months. Open access publishing and posting preprints are encouraged.\n  - **Mission publications:** Should be made publicly available at the time of their publication.\n  - **Science workshops and meetings:** Should be open to broad participation and documented in public repositories.\n- **Key Highlights:** Phrases like \"open access,\" \"posting preprints,\" and \"public repositories\" are in blue to emphasize transparency and accessibility.\n\n---\n\n### **Footer**\n- **Text:** \"Open science activities will be considered in reviews of proposals.\"\n- **Font Style:** Bold and blue, centered at the bottom of the slide.\n- **Purpose:** Serves as a concluding statement, reinforcing the importance of open science in proposal evaluations.\n\n---\n\n### **Design Features**\n- **Color Scheme:** Black text for general information, blue text for emphasis, and a light gray background for contrast.\n- **Font Style:** Professional and clean, with bold headings and regular text for details.\n- **Alignment:** Content is left-aligned within each section, ensuring readability and a structured layout.\n\n---\n\n### **Summary**\nThis slide effectively communicates proposed changes in three key areas (Data, Software, and Publications) using a structured layout. The use of vertical sections, bold headings, and highlighted text ensures clarity and draws attention to critical points. The footer reinforces the overarching theme of open science activities.",
